I've tweaked it a bit over the years.  It fills the house with an amazing aroma and tastes as good as it smells.  This takes a while to make, so I often do it on a weekend afternoon and then reheat it later in the week. Although the recipe calls for dried sour cherries, I have also made it with dried bings."
Hot Sweet Almond Brittle,"['slivered almonds', 'cider vinegar', 'sugar', 'sugar', 'salt', 'ground cumin', 'ground coriander', 'cayenne pepper']","This is one of our standard holiday gift recipes.

It is so awesome, I can't think of a single modification....it is perfect.  It is more time consuming than most tortilla soups because of the roasted veggies, but it is totally worth it.  If you wanted to go vegetarian, leave out the chicken, there is so much to this soup it would be great that way."

Mashed Plantains With Leeks and Fresh Herbs,"['water', 'low sodium chicken broth', 'plantains', 'unsalted butter', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'leek', 'fresh thyme', 'fresh italian parsley', 'sour cream', 'ground cumin', 'pecans', 'butter']",Adapted from Bon Appetite magazine. Plantains are those big bananas in the supermarket. Often used in Caribbean cooking. They are a starch and must be cooked before eating. In this recipe they are an alternative to mashed potatoes. The original recipe basically had more  butter and sour cream. Increase those if you want a richer dish.
Kosher Jewish  Pickles,"['pickling cucumbers', 'kosher salt', 'garlic', 'coriander seed', 'black peppercorns', 'fresh dill', 'ice', 'grape leaves', 'water']","Those of you who had the pleasure of growing up on the East Coast of the United States may have had one of these traditional Kosher pickles, made primarily by Jewish businesses. They are by no means your store bought pickles.  They are even better then your favorite deli's pickles.  These pickles are what all other pickles are founded on; quality.  
DO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  
In a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  
How long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.  Too many for you?  Then its time to move on.  Want a fantastic, authentic, Kosher/Jewish pickles?  You have found your recipe.  
Let us begin.

P.S.  The jar. I get my jar(s) by buying a big jar of crap pickles from a food warehouse.  Then I wash it and pour some boiling water in it, and it is ready for use.  I also boil the cap just in case, but have made many batches without ever using boiling water and I have never taken ill.  Only reason I do use the boiling water on occasion is because my wife is around."
Mexican Macaroni and Beef,"['elbow macaroni', 'ground beef', 'onion', 'chili without beans', 'cottage cheese', 'corn chips', 'salt', 'chili powder', 'buttered bread crumb']",Gebhard's Chili recipe from newspaper.
Pantry Clearing Chili Bean Soup,"['onion', 'green pepper', 'carrots', 'celery rib', 'frozen corn', 'black beans', 'pink beans', 'crushed pineapple in juice', 'french lentils', 'diced tomatoes with juice', 'tomato soup', 'water', 'chili powder', 'garlic powder', 'cumin', 'cayenne pepper', 'liquid smoke']","December 26 and the last thing I want to see as another store.  Desparation leads to inspiration and this was the result. A soupy chili with a complex flavor that is part spicy and smokey with slightly sweet undertones from the pineapple.  Since this was a pantry clearing experiment, you should feel free to do the same.  Replace the pink beans with kidney beans or use red peppers instead of green ones."
Ras El Hanout,"['coriander', 'ginger', 'cardamom', 'cumin', 'cinnamon', 'turmeric', 'black pepper', 'mace', 'cayenne pepper', 'clove']","There are as many different recipes for this as there are Moroccan cooks; this is the blend I learned in culinary school and it's darn tasty.  This recipe assumes you are using all pre- ground spices, but it's even better if you start with whole spices, toast them, and grind yourself."
Silky Chocolate Kefir Tarts,"['bittersweet chocolate chips', 'sugar', 'flour', 'kosher salt', 'eggs', 'kefir', 'vanilla', 'pie crusts']","The perfect dessert for a special occasion, or just when your sweet tooth is clamoring for attention. I like using organic plain kefir as a substitute for milk for a flavorful twist."
Mushroom Lasagna: Gluten Free and Pasta Free!,"['fresh mushrooms', 'margarine', 'olive oil', 'eggs', 'garlic salt', 'italian seasoning', 'parsley flakes', 'ricotta cheese', 'part-skim mozzarella cheese', 'italian cheese blend', 'pasta sauce']","Sauteed mushrooms replace traditional lasagna noodles, and their rich flavor and texture more than make up for the absence of meat. Use 3 T. flax seed meal mixed with 1 T. water for egg-free preparation (as noted in the ingredients). Gluten free pasta is available, but because I'm severely vitamin D deficient as a result of Celiac Disease which went undiagnosed for many years, I came up with this in order to take advantage of the vitamin D in mushrooms. The cheese and pasta sauce are the two critical ingredients that will make or break this dish. We have two sauces created by local restaurants that are available in many Ohio grocery stores: LaRosa's and Annarino's. They tie for first place as the best all-purpose sauce I've ever tasted. You might consider looking in your area for a good locally produced sauce ... but maybe we're just really lucky around here! I use Mario Batali Italian Four Cheese Blend because it's outstanding and loaded with flavor."
Creme Brulee,"['heavy cream', 'vanilla bean', 'sugar', 'eggs', 'egg yolks', 'dark brown sugar', 'fresh raspberry', 'vanilla bean', 'baking chocolate', 'pralines', 'pecans', 'coffee beans', 'bananas', 'butter', 'brandy', 'brown sugar']",
Simple Garlic &amp; Pepper Rack of Lamb,"['racks of lamb', 'oil', 'garlic', 'peppercorn', 'salt']","This is an ideal way of cooking racks of lamb when you don't want a crumbed coating.  I like to serve this with a salad & potatoes (done however takes your fancy on the day!)or with steamed vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower & carrots and a jacket baked potato, with a horror of horrors......gravy made with a pkt mix! LOL"
Chocolate Biscuits,"['self rising flour', 'butter', 'superfine sugar', 'chocolate chips', 'milk']",This is from  Small Cakes and Cookies cookbook. Wonderful book with all chocolate recipes in it.
Ridiculously Easy Chicago-Style Pizza Pie,"['frozen pie crusts', 'italian sausage', 'onion', 'mushrooms', 'mozzarella cheese', 'parmesan cheese', 'pizza sauce', 'italian seasoning', 'parmesan cheese']","Chicago-style pizza is great, but it can be a pain to make and way too expensive to buy from a restaurant... so I came up with this easy-to-make recipe.  The best Chicago pizzas usually feature cornbread crusts, but the pie crusts make a surprisingly tasty substitute!  I use this recipe by Dan-Amer #1 for the sausage (http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-bulk-italian-sausage-chicago-style-329000), but store-bought sausage should work just as well."
Makrout a Louz - Algerian Almond Cakes #2,"['ground almonds', 'granulated sugar', 'lemons%2c zest of', 'eggs', 'cornflour', 'sugar syrup', 'icing sugar']","Delicious little diamonds of tangy almond delight! Easy to make and very much appreciated by all. Perfect for Eid celebrations or any special (or not so special!) ocassion.

This is for the lemon ones - more traditionally they are lime....

You can freeze these and then put the syrup and icing sugar on later. I like to make a few things in advance so I'm not cooking 24/7 just before Eid etc. I also make these with a mix of 250g desiccated coconut + 100g ground almonds - just as tasty & a fraction of the cost!"
Shrimp Stir-Fry,"['large shrimp', 'soy sauce', 'garlic clove', 'vegetable oil', 'red bell pepper', 'onion', 'snow peas', 'water', 'pepper', 'rice']","I addapted this out of a children's cookbook. Everyone loved it so much that I have to make it once a week now, lol. You can just serve it with boil in the bag rice which is what the original recipe suggests."
"Double Pork, Double Cheese Burgers","['bacon', 'ground pork', 'garlic clove', 'thyme', 'kosher salt', 'fresh ground pepper', 'red onions', 'olive oil', 'hamburger buns', 'unsalted butter', 'camembert cheese', 'gorgonzola', 'arugula', 'tomatoes']","Food and Wine Magazine, June /07 edition. ""These burgers pair well with the crisp, coriander-inflected Lagunitas Brewing Company’s Sonoma Farmhouse Saison, modeled after the widely distributed Belgian beer Saison Dupont—also a great match."" Chef Sang Yoon  will almost always choose ale over Riesling and this is one of his beer-friendly recipes."
Brain Cookies With Blood Glaze,"['unsalted butter', 'sugar', 'all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'eggs', 'walnuts', 'vanilla', 'red food coloring', 'blue food coloring', 'icing sugar', 'red food coloring']",A great halloween cookie
Delicious Lime Cheesecake Ice Cream,"['egg yolks', 'caster sugar', 'cream cheese', 'lime curd', 'double cream', 'milk']","This is a fabulous ice cream recipe. It is THE simplest thing to put together & makes a wonderful treat.... To jazz it up sometimes I add some finely grated lime zest

Time to make doesn't include churning/freezing time ;)"
Pinto Bean Soup With Fresh Salsa,"['dried pinto beans', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'yellow onions', 'salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'garlic cloves', 'chicken stock', 'plum tomatoes', 'red onion', 'fresh cilantro', 'lime%2c juice of', 'salt %26 freshly ground black pepper', 'crema']","Despite its creamy taste, this simply prepared soup is surprisingly low in fat. A cantina cook might well make up a batch from the previous day’s leftover beans. It is the perfect antidote to a blustery day, and the fresh, sharp garnish contrasts nicely with the natural richness of the beans."
Roasted Shrimp Cocktail,"['shrimp', 'olive oil', 'kosher salt', 'fresh ground black pepper']","This recipe for shrimp cocktail is way better than any cold recipe I have ever tried! I saw it on Food Network by Ina of Barefoot Contessa... The shrimp is so flavorful!! The original recipe also included a cocktail sauce, but they were so good, we didn't even need sauce!"
Caramel Butter Brie,"['butter', 'light brown sugar', 'white sugar', 'heavy whipping cream', 'nutmeg', 'brie cheese', 'pecans']",This makes a wonderful sweet/salty appetizer to spread over crackers.  Once you cut into this the soft cheese kind of oozes out and its fabulous to spread over apple slices also.
Tiramisu Piemontese,"['mascarpone', 'eggs', 'sugar', 'marsala wine', 'espresso coffee', 'ladyfingers', 'unsweetened cocoa powder', 'sweetened cocoa powder']","One of the most celebrated delicious Italian desserts, and my Roman partner Cristiano introduced me to the best possible recipe!!

""Tiramisu"" means ""Pick me up"" in Italian (Tira mi su). I was curious about the origin of this name, and when I asked Cristiano about it, he told me this rich cake full of calories (thus it would give you lots of energy) was served traditionally as a final dessert at weddings (the Italian weddings rival to those of Greeks, they keep on eating and eating all day and night!!). This was done to assure the newly weds' very ""energetic"" and passionate honeymoon following the big feast!!"
Hemingway Special- a Caribbean Inspired Cocktail,"['white rum', 'maraschino juice', 'lime%2c juice of', 'grapefruit juice', 'blue curacao', 'pineapple juice']","A spin off of the ""Hemingway Special"" Serve in a frosty glass over ice and you are set to sample a taste of the Caribbean!"
New Orleans Skillet Baked Cornbread,"['yellow cornmeal', 'flour', 'sugar', 'baking powder', 'salt', 'allspice', 'fresh ground white pepper', 'egg', 'milk', 'vegetable shortening', 'shortening']","This cornbread makes an excellent side for ""New Orleans Red Beans and Rice"" recipe #87365. This recipe also comes from the same cookbook, ""The New Orleans CookBook"" by Rima and Richard Collin. I highly recommend using bacon grease (I used pepper bacon) rather than shortening to grease the cast iron skillet. I have made this recipe both ways and the bacon adds that extra special touch that really gives a nice tie-in with the Red Beans and Rice."
Crab &amp; Fresh Basil Stuffed Mushrooms,"['monterey jack cheese', 'plain breadcrumbs', 'kosher salt', 'green onions', 'fresh basil', 'tabasco sauce', 'dry white wine', 'fresh lemon juice', 'garlic clove', 'egg', 'fresh crabmeat', 'button mushrooms', 'cooking oil']","A wonderful tasting and attractive hors d’oeuvre that can easily be made ahead of time, to be baked later. I sampled these at a friends art opening and had to have the recipe. Everyone was raving over how good they were and could not believe that she hadn't hired someone to make them."
Absolutely Delightful Scalloped Potatoes,"['potatoes', 'cream of mushroom soup', 'cream of chicken soup', 'evaporated milk', 'salt and pepper', 'cheddar cheese']",These are our family's favorite scalloped potatoes.

Kickin' Shrimp Dip,"['cream cheese', 'sour cream', 'old bay seasoning', 'lemon juice', 'cayenne pepper', 'worcestershire sauce', 'chili powder', 'cooked shrimp']","I've tried a lot of shrimp dip recipes, and I finally decided to be creative and make my own! This has a bit of heat, since I've found that cream cheese- based dips are often bland.
We like this on buttery crackers, and celery sticks. Cooking time is chilling time."

Saw this on food network and found the recipe on about.com   There are two others on zaar but this one is just a little different.  The longer you can wait to use it the better but can be used right away.

Beat and Bake Sponge Cake,"['margarine', 'sugar', 'flour', 'baking powder', 'milk', 'eggs', 'vanilla essence']","I have tried other sponge cake recipes and they always flop for me.  My mother use to make this when we were kids.  She doubled the ingredients and made it in one of those large oven trays that often come with the oven.  It never lasted long enough to come out of the tray!  As a variation, you could add lemon or orange rind to the mix, or even granadilla seeds."

My sister cooked up some skewers of shrimp, chicken and onions over the weekend, and we found this to be a wonderful dipping sauce for them.

Praline Cake Filling,"['butter', 'brown sugar', 'salt', 'evaporated milk', 'vanilla', 'pecans', 'powdered sugar', 'evaporated milk']","I was looking for a praline cake filling and found this on the internet.  I found the original recipe to be too thick.  While it didn't harden like a praline, it was just simply too thick.  I've adjusted the quantities of milk and powdered sugar in order to have a filling that is spreadable.  After it cools, you may need to thin it with a little more evaporated milk.  If it's too thick start adding one tablespoon at a time until you get a consistency that can easily be spread on a cake without tearing the cake.  You are looking for a consistency that will slowly drip off of your mixing spoon.  There are other recipes for praline fillings that aren't cooked.  However, I find that the cooking of the mixture adds extra flavor and a richness that will not achieve by just mixing the ingredients together.  I love to make a yellow cake and use this filling and ice with a chocolate buttercream frosting and then pour a chocolate ganache over the top of the cake and let it drip down the sides."
